# NovelCoOccQuantification
Scripts belonging to the paper titled Novel metrics of spatial co-occurrence reflect species interaction types in a cold-water coral reef community, by A. van der Kaaden et al. 

The script Scores_Simulations performs 100 repetitions of the Lotka-Volterra style simulations from section 2.3 of the paper. It calculates the Aggregation and Symmetry Scores, calculates the quantiles of the results, and plots the results (figure 2).

The script ScoresForAnnotatedImages performs the spatial analysis (section 3.3.1) and co-occurrence plot analysis (section 3.3.2) of the images annotated by Maier et al. (2021 - see paper for full reference). It plots figure 4 and 5.

The script Scores_Matrices draws matrices with idealized distributions of two species and calculates Aggregation and Symmetry Scores for different resolutions (section 2.2 and figure 1).
